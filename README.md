## Why It Matters
- **Stay Ahead of Disasters:** Predict floods, heatwaves, and pollution events before they strike.  
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** Integrates climate records, urban statistics, demographics, and simulated real-time streams.  
- **Actionable Insights:** Risk alerts, priority zones, and mitigation strategies delivered via an interactive dashboard.  
- **Transparent AI:** Explainable predictions highlight the key factors behind every risk assessment.

## How It Works
1. **Collect & Prep Data:** Clean, normalize, and align multi-source datasets, using synthetic streams to ensure privacy.  
2. **Predict & Analyze:** Time-series and graph-based models forecast disaster risks and capture spatial dependencies.  
3. **Decision Intelligence:** Rule-based and ML-assisted logic transforms predictions into mitigation actions.  
4. **Visualize & Act:** Interactive dashboards communicate insights to city authorities for rapid, informed decisions.
