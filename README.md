AI-Driven Smart Urban Sustainability & Disaster Mitigation Platform

Urban areas are increasingly vulnerable to climate-induced disasters such as floods, heatwaves, and air pollution, threatening public safety, economic stability, and sustainable development. Traditional urban management systems are often reactive and fragmented, lacking predictive intelligence. This project presents an AI-driven platform to forecast environmental risks and assist authorities in proactive mitigation planning.

Key Features

Predictive Risk Assessment: Machine learning models (LSTM, Random Forest, XGBoost) forecast disaster risk indicators.

Multi-Source Data Integration: Combines historical climate, urban statistics, demographic data, and synthetic real-time streams.

Decision Intelligence: Converts predictions into actionable insights, including risk alerts, vulnerability maps, and mitigation recommendations.

Explainable AI: Interprets model outputs to highlight key risk factors and improve trust.

Interactive Dashboard: Visualizes predictions and mitigation strategies for urban planners.

Scalable Architecture: Modular layers allow easy expansion and maintenance.

Methodology

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Public datasets are cleaned, normalized, aligned temporally, and aggregated spatially. Sensitive real-time data is replaced with synthetic streams.

Predictive Modeling: Time-series forecasting and graph-based spatial analysis capture temporal and inter-area dependencies for accurate disaster prediction.

Decision Layer: Risk scores are processed through rule-based and ML-assisted logic to generate mitigation strategies and priority zones.

Visualization: Interactive dashboards communicate actionable insights for proactive urban planning.
